# How to build the tutorials website

Everything can be managed through the Makefile. 
The website is built using `jupyter-book`.
Install all the required dependencies with:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gallantlab/voxelwise_tutorials.git
    cd voxelwise_tutorials
    python -m pip install ".[github,docs]"
```

## Build the website

```bash
make clean          # Remove all files generated by the website build
make build          # Build the website
make push-pages     # Push the website to GitHub pages
```

## Merge notebooks

```bash
make notebooks       # Create a new version of the merged notebooks
```
