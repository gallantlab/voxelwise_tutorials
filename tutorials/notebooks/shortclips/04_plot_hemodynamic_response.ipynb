        "\n# Visualize the hemodynamic response\n\nIn this example, we describe how the hemodynamic response function was\nestimated in the previous model. We fit the same ridge model as in the previous\nexample, and further describe the need to delay the features in time to account\nfor the delayed BOLD response.\n\nBecause of the temporal dynamics of neurovascular coupling, the recorded BOLD\nsignal is delayed in time with respect to the stimulus. To account for this\nlag, we fit encoding models on delayed features. In this way, the linear\nregression model weighs each delayed feature separately and recovers the shape\nof the hemodynamic response function in each voxel separately. In turn, this\nmethod (also known as a Finite Impulse Response model, or FIR) maximizes the\nmodel prediction accuracy. With a repetition time of 2 seconds, we typically\nuse 4 delays [1, 2, 3, 4] to cover the peak of the the hemodynamic response\nfunction. However, the optimal number of delays can vary depending on the\nexperiment and the brain area of interest, so you should experiment with\ndifferent delays.\n\nIn this example, we show that a model without delays performs far worse than a\nmodel with delays. We also show how to visualize the estimated hemodynamic\nresponse function (HRF) from a model with delays.\n"
