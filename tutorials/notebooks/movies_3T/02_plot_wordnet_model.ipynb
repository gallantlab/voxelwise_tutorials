        "\n# Fit a ridge model with wordnet features\n\n\nIn this example, we model the fMRI responses with semantic \"wordnet\" features,\nmanually annotated on each frame of the movie stimulus. The model is a\nregularized linear regression model, known as ridge regression. Since this\nmodel is used to predict brain activity from the stimulus, it is called a\n(voxelwise) encoding model.\n\nThis example reproduces part of the analysis described in Huth et al (2012)\n[1]_. See this publication for more details about the experiment, the wordnet\nfeatures, along with more results and more discussions.\n\n*Wordnet features:* The features used in this example are semantic labels\nmanually annotated on each frame of the movie stimulus. The semantic labels\ninclude nouns (such as \"woman\", \"car\", or \"building\") and verbs (such as\n\"talking\", \"touching\", or \"walking\"), for a total of 1705 distinct category\nlabels. To interpret our model, labels can be organized in a graph of semantic\nrelashionship based on the `Wordnet <https://wordnet.princeton.edu/>`_ dataset.\n\n*Summary:* We first concatenate the features with multiple temporal delays, to\naccount for the slow hemodynamic response. We then fit a predictive model of\nBOLD activity, using a  linear regression that weighs each delayed feature\ndifferently. The linear regression is regularized to improve robustness to\ncorrelated features and to improve generalization. The optimal regularization\nhyperparameter is selected over a grid-search with cross-validation. Finally,\nthe model generalization performance is evaluated on a held-out test set,\ncomparing the model predictions with the corresponding ground-truth fMRI\nresponses.\n"

The L2 regularizatin improves robustness\nto correlated features and improves generalization. However, the L2\nregularization is controled by a hyperparameter ``alpha`` that needs to be\ntuned. This regularization hyperparameter is usually selected over a grid\nsearch with cross-validation, selecting the hyperparameter that maximizes the\npredictive performances on the validation set. More details about\ncross-validation can be found in the `scikit-learn documentation\n<https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html>`_.\n\nFor computational reasons, when the number of features is larger than the\nnumber of samples, it is more efficient to solve a ridge regression using the\n(equivalent) dual formulation [2]_. This dual formulation is equivalent to\nkernel ridge regression with a linear kernel. Here, we have 3600 training\nsamples, and 1705 * 4 = 6820 features (we multiply by 4 since we use 4 time\ndelays), therefore it is more efficient to use kernel ridge regression.\n\nWith one target, we could directly use the pipeline in ``scikit-learn``'s\n``GridSearchCV``, to select the optimal regularization hyperparameter\n(``alpha``) over cross-validation. However, ``GridSearchCV`` can only\noptimize one score. Thus, in the multiple-target case, ``GridSearchCV`` can\nonly optimize (for example) the mean score over targets. Here, we want to\nfind a different optimal hyperparameter per target/voxel, so we use the\npackage `himalaya <https://github.com/gallantlab/himalaya>`_ which implements\na ``scikit-learn`` compatible estimator ``KernelRidgeCV``, with\nhyperparameter selection independently on each target.\n\n"
