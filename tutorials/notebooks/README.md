# Jupyter notebooks

This directory contains a copy of each python script as a jupyter notebook.
These notebooks are generated automatically by `sphinx-gallery`, and do not
render any content. To see rendered versions of the tutorials, go to the
[tutorials website](https://gallantlab.github.io/voxelwise_tutorials) (soon).

## Run the notebooks
To run the notebooks yourself, you first need to download this repository and
install the `voxelwise_tutorials` package:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gallantlab/voxelwise_tutorials.git
    cd voxelwise_tutorials
    pip install .
```

For more info about how to run jupyter notebooks, see
[the official documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
