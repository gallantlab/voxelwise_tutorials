Voxelwise modeling tutorials
============================


Welcome to the voxelwise modeling tutorials from the
`Gallantlab <https://gallantlab.org>`_.

Getting started
---------------

This website contains tutorials describing how to use the
`voxelwise modeling framework <voxelwise_modeling.html>`_.

The tutorials consist of Python scripts, which are rendered in a `gallery of
examples <_auto_examples/index.html>`_. Each Python script is also available as
a Jupyter notebook (non-rendered). The tutorials are best explored in
order, starting with the "Movies 3T tutorial".

To run the tutorials yourself, we recommend to download the project on GitHub
at `gallantlab/voxelwise_tutorials
<https://github.com/gallantlab/voxelwise_tutorials>`_. On top of the tutorials,
the GitHub repository contains a Python package called ``voxelwise_tutorials``,
which contains useful fonctions to download the data sets, load the files,
process the data, and visualize the results. Install instructions are available
`here <voxelwise_package.html>`_. Then, run either the Python scripts or the
Jupyter notebooks located in the "tutorials" directory.
