Voxelwise modeling tutorials
============================


Welcome to the voxelwise modeling tutorial from the
`Gallantlab <https://gallantlab.org>`_.

Getting started
---------------

This website contains tutorials describing how to use the
`voxelwise modeling framework <voxelwise_modeling.html>`_.

The tutorials consist of Python scripts, which are rendered in a
`gallery of examples <auto_examples/index.html>`_.
The tutorials are best explored in order, starting with the
"Movies 3T tutorial".

To run the tutorials yourself, we recommend to download the project on
github at `gallantlab/tutorials <https://github.com/gallantlab/tutorials>`_.
On top of the tutorials, the github repository contains a Python package
called ``voxelwise``, which contains useful fonctions to download the data
sets, load the files, process the data, and visualize the results.
Install instructions are available `here <voxelwise_package.html>`_.
