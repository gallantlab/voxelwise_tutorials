Voxelwise modeling tutorials
============================


Welcome to the voxelwise modeling tutorials from the
`Gallantlab <https://gallantlab.org>`_.

Getting started
---------------

This website contains tutorials describing how to use the
`voxelwise modeling framework <voxelwise_modeling.html>`_.

To explore these tutorials, one can:

- read the rendered examples in the tutorials
  `gallery of examples <_auto_examples/index.html>`_ (recommended)
- run the Python scripts located in the GitHub repository (`tutorials <https://github.com/gallantlab/voxelwise_tutorials/tree/main/tutorials>`_ directory)
- run the Jupyter notebooks located in the GitHub repository 
  (`tutorials/notebooks
  <https://github.com/gallantlab/voxelwise_tutorials/tree/main/tutorials/notebooks>`_
  directory)
- run the merged notebook in
  `Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/github/gallantlab/voxelwise_tutorials/blob/main/tutorials/notebooks/movies_3T/merged_for_colab.ipynb>`_.

The tutorials are best explored in order, starting with the "Movies 3T"
tutorial.

The project is available on GitHub at `gallantlab/voxelwise_tutorials
<https://github.com/gallantlab/voxelwise_tutorials>`_. On top of the tutorials,
the GitHub repository contains a Python package called ``voxelwise_tutorials``,
which contains useful functions to download the data sets, load the files,
process the data, and visualize the results. Install instructions are available
`here <voxelwise_package.html>`_. Then, run either the Python scripts or the
Jupyter notebooks located in the "tutorials" directory.
