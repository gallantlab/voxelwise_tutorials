# How to build the tutorials website

Everything can be managed through the Makefile. 
The website is built using `jupyter-book`.
Install all the required dependencies with:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gallantlab/voxelwise_tutorials.git
    cd voxelwise_tutorials
    python -m pip install ".[github,docs]"
```

## Build the website

```bash
make clean          # Remove all files generated by the website build
make build          # Build the website
```

If your machine has a GPU available, it takes around 10 minutes to run the examples
and build the entire website. I don't recommend building it on a CPU, as it will take
a lot, lot longer. Successive builds will be faster, as the rendered notebooks are
cached and re-run only if they are modified.

## Preview the website

```bash
make preview        # Build and serve the website locally
```

Then open your browser at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Publish the website

```bash
make publish        # Publish the website to GitHub Pages
```

## Merge notebooks

```bash
make notebooks       # Create a new version of the merged notebooks
```
