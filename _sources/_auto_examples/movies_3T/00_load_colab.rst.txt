==================
Setup Google Colab
==================

In this script, we setup a Google Colab environment. This script will only work
when run from `Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/>`_). You can
skip it if you run the tutorials on your machine.

Change runtime to use a GPU
---------------------------

This tutorial is much faster when a GPU is available to run the computations.
In Google Colab you can request access to a GPU by changing the runtime type. 
To do so, click the following menu options in Google Colab: 

(Menu) "Runtime" -> "Change runtime type" -> "Hardware accelerator" -> "GPU".

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 23-36

Mount data with Google Drive
----------------------------

First, open the following Google Drive link:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NuxO5_GHgDvjrL2FX5ohzAsvWpZuepIA

Then, click on the directory name ("vim-5"), and add a shortcut to your Drive
("Add shortcut to Drive"). Place the shortcut in the main directory of your
Google Drive. Do not place it in another folder, or you will have to change 
the code to update the location of the dataset.

Finally, mount Google Drive in Google Colab. To do so, run the following cell,
and follow the instructions from Google to copy/paste the authorization code.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 36-40

.. code-block:: default


    from google.colab import drive
    drive.mount("/content/drive")


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 41-43

Uncomment and run the following command to check that Google Drive was
correctly mounted.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 43-46

.. code-block:: default


    # !ls drive/MyDrive/vim-5


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 47-50

Tell the voxelwise_tutorials package where the data is. (If you placed the
shortcut in a different location than the main directory of your Google
Drive, change this code to point to the correct location.)

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 50-54

.. code-block:: default


    import os
    os.environ['VOXELWISE_TUTORIALS_DATA'] = "drive/MyDrive/"


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 55-60

Install package helper
----------------------

Finally, install the tutorial helper package, by uncommenting and running
the install command.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 60-63

.. code-block:: default


    # !pip install voxelwise_tutorials


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 64-66

When using Colab, the install of pycortex might fail to locate the default
pycortex filestore. Uncomment and run the following line to fix it:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 66-69

.. code-block:: default


    # !git clone https://github.com/gallantlab/pycortex


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 70-71

Now change the pycortex filestore path.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 71-81

.. code-block:: default


    import cortex
    filestore = "/content/pycortex/filestore/"
    cortex.options.config['basic']['filestore'] = filestore
    cortex.options.config['webgl']['colormaps'] = "/content/pycortex/filestore/colormaps"
    cortex.database.db = cortex.database.Database(filestore)
    cortex.db = cortex.database.db
    cortex.utils.db = cortex.database.db
    cortex.dataset.braindata.db = cortex.database.db


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 82-83

Your Google Colab environment is now set up for the voxelwise tutorials.
